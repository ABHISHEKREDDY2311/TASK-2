# TASK-2
        I dont know this much coding but with google help im able to simualtaneously complete  the task while learning it through
        getting errors and by doing huge mistakes  even with google help and by using wrong code, at last i found that i have to improve and get better,
        thank you very much for helping me push my limits and gain knowledge and skills.
STEP 1 : i used pandas, matplotlib,seaborn as given for handling data and creating charts.
STEP 2 : i used.describe() to get Average(mean),middlevalue(median)and standard deviation for numeric columnsand 
         Checked missing values to see what info is missing.
STEP 3 : i used histograms, boxplot for visual and find out the odd ones
STEP 4 : I used correlation matrix to see how features are connected
STEP 5: I combined gender,class and age group and used barplots to see who survived more and at last i used bar charts to visualize the insights.
NOTE : This whole process is done while learning the given task
